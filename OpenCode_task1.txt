1)Git is a tool that helps to keep track of changes to code. It's like a save point for our code and allows multiple people to work on the same project.

where as , GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds features like bug tracking, project management, to make it easier for teams to collaborate and work together.

So, Git is the tool, and GitHub is a place to use the tool.

2)These are 5 git commands :

git clone :This command downloads a copy of a Git repository from a remote location to our device.

git init :This initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git add : This adds changes in a file to the staging area so that they can be included in the next commit.

git commit :This saves changes to the local Git repository, including all changes that have been added to the staging area.

git push : This sends local changes to a remote repository on a service like GitHub so that other people can access and see the changes.

3)To make a pull request :

First, we had to find the project to contribute on github and later we had to fork
 
it which will create a a copy in our device and we had to clone it and make changes to the 

file as per our requirements and push the changes back to our forked repository on github.

then we had to click on NEW PULL REQUEST button and CREATE PULL REQUEST in the original page.
